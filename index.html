  Introduction to Programming Nanodegreee. <br><br>

<p>One of the first things need to understand is some basics for HTML which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. This is the language used by the web and is the majority of what is found on the web.  <br><br>

The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents - over 30 billion and counting. There are multiple types of files on the web - Plain Text, HTML, Images, Videos, and Music. Just about anything can exist on the web. <br><br>

When getting information from the Web there are steps that are done to get the information you are looking for. <br>
1. You enter your request through the browser on your computer <br>
2. The browser sends it to the Internet. <br>
3. The Internet then searches servers using HTTPs. HTTP is the main protocal of the web. Once the information is found it is sent to your computer. <br> <br> </p>

<b> HTML Info </b> <br><br>

HTML does spacing differently from what you are used to. It treats an area of white space between letters as a signle space. It could actual be just one space or it could be a couple of lines of white space. Either way it is just one space to HTML. This is why if the correct tags are not used all lines or words entered on HTML will run together and become one long line. <br><br>

HTML Tags: <br><br>

HTML tags are used to do something specific whith what is contained within the tags. Most tags are paired - that is a beginning tag and a closing tag. This tells HTML where to start and where to end. If there is not a closing tag then HTML will keep on doing what it started. If you want a word to be in bold print and you leave off the closing tag then all words after the beginning tag will be bold.  While most tags also have a closing tag there are a few tags that do not have closing tags. These are known as Void Tags. <br><br>

HTML tags can also be classifed as In Line or Block tags. Block tags actually makes a box around the verbiage that is within the beginning and closing tags. The In Line tags does not create any sort of box or spacing around the verbiage. <br><br>

When working with a tag the entire thing is known as an element. The element is made up of the tags and the contents. The tag name and the closing tag name is enclosed in brackets (<>) with a '/' being put before the tag in the closing tag. <br><br>

tag name - contents - closing tag name <br><br>

An example would be:  <em> I like this course </em>   where 'em' is the opening tag, "I like this course" is the content, and '/em' is the closing tag. <br><br>

Some HTML tags: <br><br>

'a' and '/a' is the anchor tag - it is used for making links <br>
'b' and '/b' is to make the contents bold <br>
'em' and '/em' is to make the contents italics <br>
'img' is used for pictures and images - there is no closing tag <br>
'br' is to make a line break - there is no closing tag <br>
'p' and '/p' is for paragraph - the contents will be put in a box (which is not seen) <br>
'strong' <br>
'div' <br>
'form' <br><br>

In Line HTML Tags: <br>
'b' <br>
'em' <br>
'img' <br>
'span' <br>
'br' <br>
'a' <br>
'strong' <br><br>

Block HTML Tags: <br>
'p' <br>
'div' <br>
'form' <br><br>

Void HTML Tags (no closing tag needed): <br>
'br' <br>
'img' <br><br>
